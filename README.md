# CPSC-386-Pacman
Pacman Portal game, based on the classic Pacman game, and the classic Portal (3d) game. Pacman goes around a 2d maze eating points, while four ghostschase him and try to eat him. Four power points (in the corners of the maze) cause the ghosts to change to blue and run away. Pacman can then eat the ghost, and its eyes will run to the ghost spawning location at the center of the screen. Pacman also has a portal gun (orange and blue portals) to allow him to transport from one portal to another. The portals then close; the ghosts can't transport.
